While different modalities, including facial expression, brain waves, speech, skin conductance and blood volume offer valuable insights, modalities like eye behavior and audio provide exceptionally rich information and can be easily and non-invasively collected in mobile contexts without physical movement restrictions. Such rich information is highly correlated with cognitive and affective states, and is reflected not only in conventional eye and speech behavior such as gaze, pupil size, blink, linguistics and paralinguistic, but also newly developed behavior descriptors such as eyelid movement, the interaction between the eyelid, iris and pupil, eye action units, heart and breathing sensing through in-ear microphones, abdominal sound sensing via custom belt-shaped wearables, and the sequence and coordination of multimodal behavior events. The high-dimensional nature of the available information makes eye and audio sensing ideal for multimodal affect analysis. However, fundamental and state-of-the-art eye and audio behavior computing has not been widely introduced to the audience in the form of tutorial. Meanwhile, advancements in wearables and head-mounted devices like Apple Vision Pro, smart glasses or VR make them the likely next generation of computing devices, providing novel opportunities to explore new types of eye behavior and new methods of body sound sensing for affect analysis and modelling. Therefore, this tutorial will focus on eye and audio modality computing, using an eye camera and a microphone as examples, and multimodal wearable computing approaches, using the modalities of the eye, speech and head movement as examples, aiming to propel the development of future multimodal affective computing systems in diverse domains. <br/><br/>This tutorial contains four parts, with the full program shown in the table below. <br/></span><table id="table_3c89489e" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" >	<tr>
